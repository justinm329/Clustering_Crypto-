# Clustering_Crypt_Summary

* In this activity I wanted to group all the different kinds of cryptos that are in the market to assist in putting together a portfolio for customers.
  I used a dataframe that had different information that all crytocurriences share to cluster them into different groups. This would assit in the team to figure out what   cryptocurriences would be best in the portfolio. We look at Algorithm, Proof Type, Total Coins Mined, TotalCoin Supply to assist in the clustering process. Once we      cleaned and processed the data we were able to graph and show in a new dataframe which coins fell in what cluster. Given this data it will be easier to decide which  cryptocurriences we will include in customer portfolios.
