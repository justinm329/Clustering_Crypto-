# Clustering_Crypto

## Description 
* You are a Senior Manager at the Advisory Services team on a Big Four firm. One of your most important clients, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers, however, they are lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies. They ask you to help them make sense of it all by generating a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification. I used an unsupervivsed learning model that  clustered cryptocurrencies and created plots to present your results.
 
 ## Objective 
  Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means. Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn. Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn. Create some plots and data tables to present the results.
